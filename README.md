# Console Adventures

Console Adventures is a simple game written in plain javascript that allows you to experience a story of a 15 year old boy, discover his magical power that he inherited from his parents.

The story allows you to travel this magical world and control the character's actions. Each action has different outcome and you can experience them all just by playing the game again!
